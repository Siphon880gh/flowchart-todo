## :page_facing_up: Description:
By Weng Fei Fung. You've designed an SVG flowchart to outline automation or technical implementations. To enhance interactivity, you'd like to include checkboxes that can be checked off by team members or yourself as each technology component is implemented. By adding data-checkbox to each SVG child you want to have a checkbox, this will create a teamspace where anyone with the URL can see the checkboxes or modify them.

Note it is not real-time yet. Plan to make it real-time and add a chatroom.
